This directory contains some Julia code to quickly visualize the numerical results
generated using the code and setups described in the `code` directory of this repository.
The final figures shown in the article have been generated using the MATLAB script
`main_script_URE_vis.m`. Please follow the instructions and adapt the paths described
in the script to create all figures step by step.
